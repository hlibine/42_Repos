# Welcome to My 42 Cursus Repository

Welcome to my repository containing all the projects and exercises I've developed during my studies at 42.

## Finished Projects

Here's a list of projects that I have completed so far:

- **Libft + Bonus**: My very first project at 42. It's a C library that reproduces the behavior of several standard C library functions, along with some additional useful functions.

- **ft_printf**: A custom implementation of the C standard `printf` function. It handles various format specifiers and flags, providing formatted output to the standard output.

- **get_next_line**: A function that allows reading a line from a file descriptor. Useful for parsing files line by line.

- **Born2beRoot + Bonus**: A project aimed at making me familiar with system administration by setting up my own server, and following strict rules.

- **PushSwap + Bonus**: This project requires making a sorting algorithm while only having a specific set of operations available to you, this algorithm has to be as optimized as possible (meaning the least amount of operations used)

## Ongoing Projects

- **pipex**: A project that teaches basic UNIX operations and focuses on three main concepts: pipelines, child processes, and execution of commands.
