## Finished Projects

I am proud to showcase my completed projects which allow me to see just how far ive come:

- **[get_next_line](https://github.com/hlibine/get_next_line)**: Tailor-made function to extract and return lines from given file descriptors, enhancing file parsing capabilities line by line.

- **[Born2beRoot + Bonus](https://github.com/hlibine/born2beroot)**: A deep dive into system administration, mandating the conception of a secure and well-structured server environment.

- **[PushSwap + Bonus](https://github.com/hlibine/push_swap)**: The epitome of algorithmic refinement, revolving around a constrained set of operations to sort data in minimal possible moves - featuring the "Turk algorithm".
